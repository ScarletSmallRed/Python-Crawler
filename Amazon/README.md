Use the code to take the behavior of the simulated browser: Enter the text, Click Search and Page Turn. Finally wait for the page to load before grabbing the content on the [Amazon website](https://www.amazon.com/).

Selenium is a web-based automated testing tool originally developed for website automation testing. Types like the button wizards we use to play games can be operated automatically according to the specified commands. The difference is that Selenium can run directly on the browser, it supports All major browsers, but PhantomJS is no longer supported, generally using chrome and firefox without an interface browser.

Selenium can use our instructions to let the browser automatically load the page, get the data it needs, even page screenshots, or determine if certain actions on the site occur.
